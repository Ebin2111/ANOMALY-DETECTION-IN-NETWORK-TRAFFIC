# ANOMALY-DETECTION-IN-NETWORK-TRAFFIC
Designed a machine learning–based system to detect abnormal patterns in network traffic data. The model analyzes traffic behavior, extracts key features, and identifies deviations from normal activity. This approach enables early detection of potential security threats and supports proactive network monitoring and reliability.

**Key Features**

*Network traffic data preprocessing and feature extraction

*Identification of abnormal patterns using machine learning models

*Distinction between normal and anomalous network behavior

*Scalable approach for large network traffic datasets

*Support for proactive monitoring and threat detection


**Methodology**

The project involves cleaning and normalizing network traffic data, followed by feature engineering to capture meaningful traffic behavior. Machine learning algorithms are applied to model normal network activity, and deviations from learned patterns are flagged as anomalies.

**Tech Stack**

*Programming Language: Python

*Machine Learning: Anomaly Detection Algorithms

*Data Processing: Feature extraction and normalization

*Visualization: Matplotlib


**Use Cases**

*Network intrusion detection systems (IDS)

*Cybersecurity monitoring and analytics

*Detection of abnormal network usage or attacks

*IT infrastructure monitoring



**Output**

The system produces anomaly scores and classifications that highlight unusual network traffic patterns, helping identify potential intrusions, attacks, or performance issues.



**Conclusion**

This project demonstrates the application of machine learning for cybersecurity by enabling automated detection of abnormal network behavior. It supports proactive threat identification and strengthens network defense mechanisms.
