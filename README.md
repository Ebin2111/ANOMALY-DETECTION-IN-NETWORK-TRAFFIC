# ANOMALY-DETECTION-IN-NETWORK-TRAFFIC
Designed a machine learning–based system to detect abnormal patterns in network traffic data. The model analyzes traffic behavior, extracts key features, and identifies deviations from normal activity. This approach enables early detection of potential security threats and supports proactive network monitoring and reliability.
